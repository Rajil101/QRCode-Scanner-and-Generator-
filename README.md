•**scanQRcode**- In these activity i used scanner live view  and ZXDecoder() for decoding & scanning the code, checked premission and grant decision to camera and make final toast for message output showing,

•**genrateQRcode**- In these activity, firstly inherited the xml function like buttons,selectors proceed to get text value of genrate qrcode and create bitmap, 

•**main activity**- In this we simply redirected this activity to home activity for initialize first screen, 

•**home activity** where intial input taken from user to select which process to follow such as Genrate QR-code or Scan new one and just intialize the onclicklistner for both activity.

•Also made changes in the manifest file to first open home activity not main activity.
